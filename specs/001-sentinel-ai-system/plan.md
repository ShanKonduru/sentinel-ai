# Implementation Plan: Sentinel AI System

**Branch**: `001-sentinel-ai-system` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `C:\MyProjects\sentinel_ai\specs\001-sentinel-ai-system\spec.md`

## Summary
Primary requirement: Centralized monitoring system for AI agents with real-time and historical metrics (latency, throughput, cost, CPU/GPU, memory). Technical approach: Microservices architecture with Docker containers, Python backend services (Flask/FastAPI), React frontend, PostgreSQL database, supporting multiple concurrent users with data filtering and export capabilities.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 for backend services, JavaScript/TypeScript for React frontend  
**Primary Dependencies**: Flask (metrics collection API), FastAPI (DB REST API), React (dashboard), PostgreSQL (database), Docker (containerization)  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL database with high availability configuration  
**Testing**: pytest for Python services, Jest/React Testing Library for frontend  
**Target Platform**: Docker containers, Linux server deployment  
**Project Type**: web - requires frontend + backend architecture  
**Performance Goals**: Metrics API ≥1000 req/s, <50ms latency, Dashboard <3s load time  
**Constraints**: Minimal metrics collector footprint, 90% test coverage required, PEP 8 compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: Multiple concurrent users, real-time data collection, historical data analysis, data export functionality

- Dashboard <3s load time requirement addressed

**Governance**: ✅ PASS
- Code reviews and CI/CD checks will verify constitutional compliance
- All decisions documented with clear rationale

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Frontend dashboard + multiple backend services requires separation

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research Docker best practices for microservices deployment
   - Investigate PostgreSQL high availability configuration options
   - Study D3.js integration patterns with React
   - Research metrics collection patterns with minimal overhead

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research Docker microservices deployment best practices for Python Flask/FastAPI services"
   Task: "Find PostgreSQL high availability patterns for metrics storage"
   Task: "Research D3.js React integration for real-time data visualization"
   Task: "Find lightweight metrics collection patterns for AI agents"
   Task: "Research REST API performance optimization for 1000+ req/s"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technology decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - AI Agent entity (id, name, status, metadata)
   - Metrics entity (time-series data with immutable records)
   - User Session entity (dashboard interactions, preferences)
   - Configuration entity (collection settings, thresholds)

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - POST /api/v1/metrics - Metrics collection endpoint
   - GET /api/v1/agents - Agent listing and status
   - GET /api/v1/metrics - Historical data retrieval with filtering
   - GET /api/v1/export - Data export functionality
   - Output OpenAPI specifications to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - contract_metrics_post_test.py
   - contract_agents_get_test.py  
   - contract_metrics_get_test.py
   - contract_export_get_test.py
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Integration test: Engineer diagnosing performance issues
   - Integration test: Team lead analyzing costs
   - Integration test: Data analyst exporting historical data
   - Integration test: Dashboard showing agent status indicators

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Run update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot
   - Add: Python 3.11, Flask, FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Docker
   - Update recent changes with current feature

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)
- Database setup before API services
- Backend services before frontend integration

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
- Docker container setup (5 tasks)
- Database schema and models (4 tasks)  
- Backend API implementation (12 tasks)
- Frontend dashboard development (10 tasks)
- Integration and testing (8 tasks)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No constitutional violations identified. The microservices architecture aligns with modularity requirements, open source stack meets technology constraints, and immutable data model satisfies the data integrity principle.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
