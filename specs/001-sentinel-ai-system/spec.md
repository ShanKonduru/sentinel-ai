# Feature Specification: Sentinel AI System

**Feature Branch**: `001-sentinel-ai-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Sentinel AI System Specification - This document provides a high-level overview of the Sentinel AI System, focusing on the "what" and "why" from a user and product perspective."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
AI engineers and team leads need a centralized monitoring system to observe the performance, cost, and resource utilization of their AI agents. Users access a visual dashboard to analyze real-time and historical metrics, enabling data-driven decisions for optimization and cost management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an AI engineer wants to diagnose performance issues, **When** they log into the dashboard and select a specific agent, **Then** they can view real-time and historical graphs of latency, CPU, and memory usage to identify bottlenecks
2. **Given** a team lead needs to manage costs, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they can view cost-per-agent data and analyze trends to make resource scaling decisions
3. **Given** a data analyst requires historical data, **When** they select an agent and time range, **Then** they can export performance data for custom analysis
4. **Given** multiple agents are running, **When** a user views the dashboard, **Then** they can see clear status indicators (up/down) for each monitored agent
5. **Given** a team lead wants to manage cloud budget, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** they can see total GPU utilization across all agents

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an agent goes offline or becomes unresponsive?
- How does the system handle data collection failures or network interruptions?
- What occurs when the PostgreSQL database reaches capacity limits?
- How are metrics handled during agent restarts or deployments?
