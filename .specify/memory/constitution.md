# Sentinel AI System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Quality Standards
**Code Quality**: All code MUST adhere to PEP 8 style guide for Python. Code MUST be well-documented with clear docstrings for all functions and classes.

**Testing**: All components MUST have a minimum of 90% test coverage. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are REQUIRED for each major feature.

**Rationale**: High code quality ensures maintainability, reduces bugs, and facilitates team collaboration. Comprehensive testing provides confidence in system reliability and enables safe refactoring.

### II. User Experience Consistency
**Simplicity**: The dashboard UI MUST be intuitive and easy to navigate for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

**Clarity**: Visualizations (graphs, charts) MUST be clear, well-labeled, and easy to interpret.

**Responsiveness**: The dashboard UI MUST be fully responsive and function correctly on desktop and tablet devices. Mobile support is explicitly excluded from the initial release scope.

**Rationale**: Consistent user experience reduces learning curve, improves adoption rates, and ensures the system serves users effectively across different skill levels and device types.

### III. Non-Negotiable Principles
**Modularity**: The system MUST be built with a modular architecture, allowing individual components to be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

**Open Source First**: All software components MUST be built using open-source technologies and libraries.

**Immutability**: Data stored in the PostgreSQL database MUST be immutable. Updates to metrics MUST be handled by adding new records, not modifying existing ones.

**Rationale**: Modularity enables parallel development and easier maintenance. Open source ensures transparency, reduces vendor lock-in, and leverages community support. Data immutability provides audit trails and prevents data corruption.

### IV. Governance
**Principle Enforcement**: Adherence to these principles MUST be verified during code reviews and through automated CI/CD checks.

**Decision Making**: Any proposed changes to these core principles MUST be approved by the project lead and documented with clear rationale.

**Rationale**: Structured governance ensures constitutional compliance and provides a clear process for necessary evolution while maintaining project integrity.

## Performance Standards

**Metrics Collector**: MUST have minimal resource footprint to avoid impacting the performance of monitored AI agents.

**REST API Performance**: The Performance Metrics Collection REST API MUST handle at least 1,000 requests per second with average latency under 50ms.

**Dashboard Performance**: Dashboard data loading time MUST be under 3 seconds on a stable network connection.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All code reviews and automated checks MUST verify compliance with these principles.

Complexity that violates these principles MUST be justified with documented rationale and approved by project leadership.

Amendment proposals MUST include impact analysis, migration plan, and updated version documentation.
